# diffusion-limited-aggregation-fractal
Numeric simulation of a diffusion-limited aggregation process, with fractal dimension estimation.

Python 3 code 'DLA.py' implements the numeric simulation. Jupyter notebook 'DLA_plot.ipynb' creates a plot of the fractal, counts the number of particles inside different radius and estimates the fractal dimension. PDF file '143.pdf' contains a scientific article about the subject.
